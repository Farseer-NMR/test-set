# 1_zz_axis

Routines performed along the _zz-axis_.

## test_1

- uses pkl_set_0
- peaklists were copied to the respective dimension
- `.csv` files renamed to `pkl_00.csv` because names accross dimensions must be equal.
- without expanding `missing` on `zz`

## test_2

- same as test_1
- with `"expand_missing_zz": true`

# test_3

- same as test_2
- For Asn15, CSPs of 0.01 ppm in pkl_01 and 0.1 ppm in pkl_02, in each dimension.
