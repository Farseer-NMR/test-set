Inside each `test_` folder there is a `spectra` folder and `JSON` configuration file with the variations of each test.

## 0_xx_axis

- tests functionalities along the xx_axis

## 1_zz_axis

- uses variations of peaklist dataset 0 (`pkl_set_0`)
- tests functionalities along the zz_axis

## 2_yy_axis
